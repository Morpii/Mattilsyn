## Overview ðŸ“œ

This is a single-page web application that allows users to search for restaurants and be presented with the last inspecton from Mattilsynet. 

The **front end** was written with `React`, utilising `TypeScript` and `axios`. The front end runs on `localhost:3000`




## **Install guide**

To install and run it locally, consult the following steps: 
    

1. Clone the front end repository with 
    ```
    https://github.com/Morpii/Mattilsyn.git
    ```
    or if you are using SSH 

        git@github.com:Morpii/Mattilsyn.git

2. `pull` the `main` branch down to your local machine, which also means you might have `remote add` if not automatically managed by cloning already.

### **Getting the _front end_ working**
1.  Go to the folder containing your `front end`. 
1.  Run `npm install`. 
1.  Start the app with `npm start`.

After following the above steps, the `React` app (front end) _should be_ up and running. It should start automatically after running the front end step 2. in your default browser, a the page should be presented to you. 

**If there is the case that the app does not automatically start**:

Open a browser of your choice and copy paste `localhost:3000`.
